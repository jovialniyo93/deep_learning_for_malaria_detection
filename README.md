# Deep Learning with Regularization Techniques for Malaria Identification

<br/>

<br/>


The code in this repository is supplementary to our future publication "A Novel Regularized Data Augmentation Deep Learning Architecture for Automated Malaria Parasites Identification in Thin-blood Smear Images" 


# Design and Implementation details

The objective of this project is to discern the presence of malaria from cell images, capitalizing on a dataset composed of 27,558 images categorized into equal parts of parasitized and uninfected cells. Each category boasts 13,779 images, meticulously compiled to facilitate the training of a predictive model. These images, characterized by their RGB composition, offer a comprehensive basis for analysis.

In the backdrop of the global health landscape, malaria represents a formidable challenge, with an estimated 219 million cases reported in 87 countries during 2017, culminating in approximately 435,000 deaths. The disease's prevalence is particularly pronounced in the WHO African Region, which accounted for 92% of cases and 93% of mortalities in the same year. Financial efforts to combat this scourge reached an estimated $3.1 billion, underscoring the international commitment to malaria control and elimination.

Central to the spread of malaria are Plasmodium parasites, transmitted via the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, known as malaria vectors. Among the five parasite species capable of infecting humans, P. falciparum and P. vivax are identified as the primary threats. This project seeks not only to advance the detection and classification of malaria through image analysis but also to contribute to the broader fight against a disease that continues to exert a heavy toll on global health.
